# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis
---
This project focuses on analyzing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding the features affecting the classification of tumors as malignant or benign.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the dataset, develop actionable insights for early diagnosis and treatment planning, and practice data science techniques such as data preprocessing, feature exploration, and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, check for missing values, and convert categorical data to numerical.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize dataset statistics, visualize data distributions, and explore relationships between features.
3. **Visualization**: Create histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand the data better.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Identify key features correlated with cancer diagnosis and provide actionable insights for early detection.

## How to Use
### **Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
